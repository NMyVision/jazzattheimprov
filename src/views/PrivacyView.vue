                When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the
                visitor's IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created
                from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are
                using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After
                approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

                If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF
                GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the
                website.

                If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in
                cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you
                leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year. If you visit our login page, we will set a
                temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and
                is discarded when you close your browser. When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save
                your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen
                options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If

            <PageArticle title="Embedded Content from other websites">

                Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded
                content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other
                website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking,
                and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
                embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

            <PageArticle title="How long we retain your data">

                If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
                recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation
                queue. For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they
                provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time
                (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that
                information.

                of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
                that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep
                for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
