      <p class="leading-loose text-indigo-100">At Jazz at the Improv Society, our mission is twofold: to ensure that jazz never fades into obscurity and to provide a platform for both legendary and emerging jazz performers to captivate audiences with their musical prowess. Our society is committed to preserving the authenticity of jazz, fostering innovation within the genre, and passing on the rich legacy of jazz improvisation to future generations.</p>
